# sha256
 
 An implementation of `SHA-256` from scratch in Go, following [FIPS 180-4](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf) as a learning exercise.

 Feel free to do what you want with this. Note that it's most likely very inefficient due to calculating constants each time (again, learning exercise).
